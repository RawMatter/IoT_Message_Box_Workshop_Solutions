# About US

This sample code was prepared by [Andy](http://andy.rawmatter.io) from [Raw Matter](http://rawmatter.io) as part of an introductory workshop for creating *Things* that connect to the AWS IoT Core.

As nerds for hire, Raw Matter develop robotics, electronics & software for commercial applications. We would welcome the chance to discuss your needs with you. We are also the organising sponsors for the [Perth electronics group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/perthelectronics) and recommend reaching out to that community for help with personal projects.

# Accessing the workshop
Additional workshop notes and clearer documentation is available in the [workshop repository](https://github.com/RawMatter/IoT_Message_Box_Workshop)

We have seperated the source code for each part of the workshop into discrete stages. Each of these 7 stages is an independant platform io project. Each of these stages can be opened individually as platform IO project with the full file structure. If you have the time we recomend you work through the documentation in the primary workshop repository.
